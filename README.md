# Predicting-Turnover-rate-for-a-motor-company
The goal of the project was to analyze the data collected by the HR department and to build a model that predicts whether or not an employee will leave the company.

I analyzed the data at hand, cleaned and transformed it, did basic EDA and build a Random Forest & Decision Tree Classifier to predict about the turnover i.e. whether or not an employee will leave the company.

After conducting feature engineering, the decision tree model achieved AUC of 93.8%, precision of 87.0%, recall of 90.4%, f1-score of 88.7%, and accuracy of 96.2%, on the test set. The random forest modestly outperformed the decision tree model.
